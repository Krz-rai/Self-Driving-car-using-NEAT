# Self-Driving-car-using-NEAT
This Python project uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve a car AI that avoids obstacles (rocks) while collecting coins. The AI learns to navigate using a feed-forward neural network that controls the car's left and right movement based on the environment.
